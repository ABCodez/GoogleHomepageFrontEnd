# GoogleHomepageFrontEnd

## Objective
This web based application built in VSCode uses HTML and CSS to create the Google Homepage.
By using various vector images, google fonts, etc. I was able to create the webpage with ease. 
Previous front-end development skills from Android Studio allowed for a smooth transition between mobile to web applications.

## References
By following coding tutorials from @WittCode on Youtube, I was able to achieve a great outcome.
